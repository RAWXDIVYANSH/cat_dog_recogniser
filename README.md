# Cat Dog Recogniser

It is a CNN model built from scratch. Trained on 4000 images of cats and dogs respectively and tested on set of 2000 images. It is a 2 layered convolution layered model
which classifies whether the image given is of cat or dog.

# Face Detector

It contains a face detector model made with the OpenCV dnn module. The caffemodel(CNN model) on which the data is trained consist of 152 layer and it is able to detect faces in images and videos in real time.
