# Cat Dog Recogniser

It is a CNN model built from scratch. Trained on 4000 images of cats and dogs respectively and tested on set of 2000 images. It is a 2 layered convolution layered model
which classifies whether the image given is of cat or dog.

# Face Detector

Face directory contains a face detector model made with the OpenCV dnn module. The caffemodel(CNN model) on which the data is trained consist of 152 layer and it is able to detect faces in images and videos in real time.

# FaceRecognition

It is complete face recognition model which is made with the help of OpenCV's deep neural network package. Input your own dataset, tune the SVM strictness(C)
varible on your own data. I have used 10-15 images of each person to train but the more images you will use the better will be the accuracy. Model is working both on images and live video stream in real time. It is even able to recognise image within an image.
